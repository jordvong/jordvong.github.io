                Hi! I am a 21-year-old college student interested in the arts and the coffee!
                I attend UMass Dartmouth and am going for my BFA in Graphic Design! Aside from art,
                my hobbies include listening to lo-fi, playing board games, and having existential and
                surreal conversations with my friends about our place in the world. Ya know, as one does.
